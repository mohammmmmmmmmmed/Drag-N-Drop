# Drag N Drop

## Overview

**Drag N Drop** is a task management application inspired by Kanban boards such as Jira and Trello. Built with TypeScript and React, this application leverages the `React-Beautiful-DnD` library to provide a seamless drag-and-drop experience. It allows users to manage tasks by creating boards, lists, and cards, enabling a visual and interactive way to organize projects and workflows.

## Features

- **Board Management**: Create and manage multiple boards for different projects.
- **List Management**: Within each board, create lists to categorize tasks.
- **Card Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks (cards) within lists.
- **Drag and Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for reordering lists and cards, powered by `React-Beautiful-DnD`.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strongly-typed code for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
